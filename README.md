Technical Approach for AI-Powered Rail Madad Complaint Management
The system will automate complaint handling through image, video, and text analysis, integrating AI to categorize, prioritize, and route complaints efficiently. Here is the technical breakdown:

1. Image/Video Analysis
Objective: Automate the categorization of complaints based on media uploads like photos or videos.
Technology:
TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning models, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition (e.g., detecting coach cleanliness, damages).
OpenCV: For video analysis, extracting frames and identifying patterns in visual data.
YOLO (You Only Look Once): For real-time object detection in videos and images.

2. Text Recognition (OCR)
Objective: Extract textual information from images and videos, such as signage or official documents.
Technology:
Tesseract OCR: For text extraction from images.
PyTesseract/Python: To integrate OCR capabilities within the AI models and extract important complaint data.

3. AI Chatbots for Complaint Collection
Objective: Provide real-time interaction with passengers, offering instant responses and gathering more details.
Technology:
Dialogflow (Google Cloud): For Natural Language Processing (NLP) and chatbot development.
Rasa: Open-source NLP platform for customizable chatbots to handle multilingual queries and responses.

4. Urgency Detection & Prioritization
Objective: Automatically assess the severity of complaints by analyzing visual and text data, prioritizing urgent issues.
Technology:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Using transformers (e.g., BERT) to analyze complaint severity from text inputs.
Machine Learning (Random Forest, SVM): For classifying complaints into different urgency levels based on historical data.

5. Smart Routing and Categorization
Objective: Automatically route complaints to the appropriate department based on the complaint type (e.g., cleanliness, equipment failure).
Technology:
AI Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees): For automatically categorizing complaints based on image/video/text input.
Apache Kafka: For real-time streaming and routing data to appropriate departments.

6. Predictive Maintenance
Objective: Identify recurring issues to anticipate maintenance needs, reducing future complaints.
Technology:
Time Series Analysis (Prophet, ARIMA): For predicting trends in complaints and identifying recurring problems.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)/LSTM: For learning complaint patterns over time and predicting failures.

7. Feedback and Sentiment Analysis
Objective: Assess user feedback and identify areas for improvement based on complaints.
Technology:
Sentiment Analysis (VADER, TextBlob): To evaluate passenger sentiment in feedback forms and complaint descriptions.
Data Analytics Platforms (Tableau, Power BI): For performance monitoring and visualization of complaint data trends.

8. System Integration
Objective: Seamlessly integrate the AI-powered system into the existing Rail Madad platform.
Technology:
RESTful APIs (Node.js, Django): To create APIs that connect the AI backend with the front-end user interface and existing system.
Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL): For complaint data storage and history management.
Microservices Architecture: To modularize the system for easy scaling and maintenance.
Tech Stack Overview
Frontend:

React.js/Angular: For building a responsive, user-friendly interface.
Bootstrap/Material UI: For design and responsive UI elements.
Backend:

Node.js/Django: For creating APIs and managing server-side logic.
